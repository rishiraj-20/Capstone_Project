# Dynamic Parking Price Prediction System

This project provides 3 approaches to dynamic parking price estimation based on real-world parameters like occupancy, queue length, time of day, traffic, and more.

# Models Overview

1. Model_1  :  This is a simple logic-based prediction which predicts the price based on the trends of the occupancy in the parking lot.
2. Model_2  :  This is a multi-factor numeric pricing logic which looks on the multiple factors instead of just going for the trends of occupancy, it calculates the price based on the occupancy trends, timing, traffic, type of vehicle, and so on.
3. Pathway_Model  :  This one predicts/streams the dynamic pricing based on the demand, which is calculated using multiple factors.
